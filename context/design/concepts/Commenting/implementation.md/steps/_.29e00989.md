# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

**Concept: Commenting (User, Post)**

* **purpose** enable discussion around shared posts
* **principle** users can comment on posts that are visible to them. Comments can be added, deleted, and edited.
* **state**
  * a set of Comments with
    * an author User
    * a content String
    * an associated Post
* **actions**
  * addComment (author: User, content: String, post: Post): (comment: Comment)
    * *requires* author and post must exist, author must have visibility of the post, content cannot be empty
    * *effects* creates a comment authored by the user under the post with the text content
