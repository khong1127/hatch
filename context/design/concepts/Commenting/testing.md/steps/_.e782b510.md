# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**

   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
