# response:

Here's the updated concept specification and implementation with the requested queries to check if a user exists, returning `Promise<boolean[]>`.

```concept
Concept: PasswordAuthentication (User)

* **purpose** limit access to known users
* **principle** after a user registers with a username and a password, they can authenticate with that same username and password and be treated each time as the same user
* **state**
  * a set of Users with
    * a username String
    * a password String
* **actions**
  * register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
    * *requires* username to not already exist in the set of Users
    * *effects* creates a new user of that username and password, adds that user to the set of users, and returns the new user
  * authenticate (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
    * *requires* user of the argument username and password to exist in the set of Users
    * *effects* returns the corresponding User
* **queries**
  * _userExistsById (user: User) : (exists: boolean)
    * *requires* true
    * *effects* returns `[true]` if a user with the given ID exists, otherwise `[]`
  * _userExistsByUsername (username: String) : (exists: boolean)
    * *requires* true
    * *effects* returns `[true]` if a user with the given username exists, otherwise `[]`
```
