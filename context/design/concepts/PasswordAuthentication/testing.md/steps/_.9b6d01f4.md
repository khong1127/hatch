# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**
   * createLabel (name: String): (label: Label)
   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
```

**Concept: PasswordAuthentication (User)**

* **purpose** limit access to known users
* **principle** after a user registers with a username and a password, they can authenticate with that same username and password and be treated each time as the same user
* **state**
  * a set of Users with
    * a username String
    * a password String
* **actions**
  * register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
    * *requires* username to not already exist in the set of Users
    * *effects* creates a new user of that username and password, adds that user to the set of users, and returns the new user
  * authenticate (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
    * *requires* user of the argument username and password to exist in the set of Users
    * *effects* returns the corresponding User
