# response:

The request to edit tests for `_getUserByUsername` and `_getUserById` *now that their return type has been changed from `UserDocument` to `UserDocument[]`* presents a slight discrepancy with the provided `PasswordAuthenticationConcept.ts` file. In the provided concept file, these methods are defined to return `Promise<UserDocument | null>`.

**To fulfill the prompt's instruction, I will proceed with the assumption that the concept's `_getUserByUsername` and `_getUserById` methods have indeed been updated to return `Promise<UserDocument[]>` (an array of UserDocuments, where an empty array means no user found, and an array with one element means one user found).**

The tests will be modified to reflect this array-based return type, checking array lengths and accessing elements via `[0]`. A local `UserDocument` interface is defined in the test file for type safety, as the original `UserDocument` is not exported from the concept.

Here's the updated test file:
