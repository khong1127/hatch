# response:

To properly test the `FileConcept`, we will create `src/concepts/File/FileConcept.test.ts`. This test file will mock the external GCS utility, set up the necessary environment variables, and then thoroughly test each action for its requirements, effects, and finally, demonstrate the principle of file upload and viewing through a multi-step trace.

We will use `jsr:@std/assert` for assertions, `jsr:@std/testing/mock` for spying on the GCS utility, and `jsr:@std/testing/with_temporary_env` to manage environment variables for isolated tests.
