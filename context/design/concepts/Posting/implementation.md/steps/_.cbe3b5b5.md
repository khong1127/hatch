# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

**Concept: Posting (User, Image)**

* **purpose** allow users to publish and share content for others to see
* **principle** users can create/publish posts that consist of a caption and at least one image. These posts can be edited and deleted by their owners.
* **state**
  * a set of Posts with
    * a caption String
    * a set of Images
    * an author User
* **actions**
  * create (user: User, images: Set<Image>, caption: String): (post: Post)
    * *requires* user to exist, images cannot be empty
    * *effects* creates a new post authored by the user with its content being the caption and images given
  * delete (user: User, post: Post):
    * *requires* post to exist and belong to user
    * *effects* deletes the post for the author and their friends
  * edit (user: User, post: Post, new\_caption: String): (post: Post)
    * *requires* post to exist and belong to user
    * *effects* edits the caption of the post to be that of the new one
