# Initialization

We provide a helper database script in `@utils` that reads the environment variables in your `.env` file and initializes a MongoDB database. For normal app development, use:

```typescript
import {getDb} from "@utils/database.ts";
import SessioningConcept from "@concepts/SessioningConcept.ts"

const [db, client] = await getDb(); // returns [Db, MongoClient]
```
