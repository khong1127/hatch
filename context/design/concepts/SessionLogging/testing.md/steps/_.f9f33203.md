# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

**Concept: SessionLogging (User, Image, Flag)**

* **purpose** capture photo records of a user's activity during a trip session
* **principle** users can start sessions during which they can log image entries. Entries for a session cannot be recorded once the session is ended. Recorded entries will remain associated with the session even after it is ended.
* **state**
  * a set of Sessions with
    * an owner User
    * a set of Images
    * an active Flag
* **actions**
  * startSession (user: User): (session: Session)
    * *requires* user to exist
    * *effects* creates a new session (active = true) under the user
  * addEntry (user: User, session: Session, image: Image)
    * *requires* user to exist, session and image must exist, session must be active and belong to user
    * *effects* adds image to the set of images associated with the session
  * endSession (user: User, session: Session)
    * *requires* user to exist, session must exist and belong to user
    * *effects* ends the session (active = false)
