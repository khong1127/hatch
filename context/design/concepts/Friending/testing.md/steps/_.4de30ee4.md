# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

**Concept: Friending (User)**

* **purpose** allow users to add each other as friends to share information with
* **principle** users may add and remove each other as friends. These friendships define boundaries regarding who has access to see whose information.
* **state**
  * set of Users with
    * a set of friends User
    * a set of sentRequests Users
    * a set of receivedRequests Users
* **actions**
  * initializeFriendList (user: User)
    * *requires* user to exist, friend lists of user not already initialized
    * *effects* initializes the set of friends, sentRequests, and receivedRequests of the user to be empty
  * sendRequest (sender: User, receiver: User)
    * *requires* sender and receiver to exist, sender is not the receiver, receiver not already in sender's set of friends or sent requests
    * *effects* adds sender to receiver's set of received requests, adds receiver to sender's set of sent requests
  * acceptRequest (sender: User, receiver: User)
    * *requires* request from sender exists in receiver's set of received requests
    * *effects* removes sender from receiver's set of received requests, removes receiver from sender's set of sent requests, adds sender to receiver's set of friends and vice versa
  * removeFriend (user: User, to\_be\_removed\_friend: User)
    * *requires* to\_be\_removed\_friend to be in user's set of friends
    * *effects* removes to\_be\_removed\_friend from user's set of friends and vice versa
