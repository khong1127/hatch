# Commenting

Every action should have a comment including its signature, its requirements, and effects:

```typescript
  /**
   * createLabel (name: String): (label: Label)
   *
   * **requires** no Label with the given `name` already exists
   *
   * **effects** creates a new Label `l`; sets the name of `l` to `name`; returns `l` as `label`
   */
```

**Concept: Friending (User)**

* **purpose** allow users to add each other as friends to share information with
* **principle** Users can send friend requests to other users. Users who have received friend requests have the option to accept or deny the request. If a friend request (say between User A and User B) is accepted, then User A and User B become friends.
* **state**
  * a set of Friendships with
    * a friend 1 User
    * a friend 2 User
  * a set of FriendRequests with
    * a sender User
    * a receiver User
* **actions**
  * sendRequest (sender: User, receiver: User): (request: FriendRequest)
    * *requires* sender is not the receiver, friend request from sender to receiver or vice versa does not already exist
    * *effects* creates a new friend request from sender to receiver
  * acceptRequest (sender: User, receiver: User)
