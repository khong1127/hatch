# Documentation

Every concept should have inline documentation and commenting:

* The concept itself should be paired with its purpose.
* The state should be described next to any types.
* Any testing should be guided by the principle.
* Each action should state the requirements and effects, and tests should check that both work against variations.

**Concept: Friending (User)**

* **purpose** allow users to add each other as friends to share information with
* **principle** If user A sends a friend request to user B, and user B accepts the request, then A and B become friends. After becoming friends, either party has the option to remove the other as a friend. Alternatively, user B also has the option to deny the request from user A should they wish to.
* **state**
  * a set of Friendships with
    * a friend1 User
    * a friend2 User
  * a set of FriendRequests with
    * a sender User
    * a receiver User
* **actions**
  * sendRequest (sender: User, receiver: User)
    * *requires* sender is not the receiver, friend request from sender to receiver does not already exist
    * *effects* creates a new friend request from sender to receiver
  * acceptRequest (sender: User, receiver: User)
    * *requires* request from sender to receiver to exist
    * *effects* removes friend request, records friendship between sender and user
  * denyRequest (sender: User, receiver: User)
    * *requires* request from sender to receiver to exist
    * *effects* removes friend request
  * removeFriend (user: User, to\_be\_removed\_friend: User)
    * *requires* friendship between user and to\_be\_removed\_friend must exist
    * *effects* removes friendship between user and to\_be\_removed\_friend
