# 6.104 Assignment 4: Implementing Concepts

Here is a list of where to find different parts of my work:
* Concept specifications
  * design --> concepts --> (Concept Name) --> (Concept Name).md
* Concept files about design changes and other issues
  * design --> concepts --> (Concept Name) --> (Concept Name)_moments.md
* Concept implementation
  * src --> concepts --> (Concept Name) --> (Concept Name).ts
* Concept testing
  * src --> concepts --> (Concept Name) --> (Concept Name).test.ts
* Concept console test output
  * src --> concepts --> (Concept Name) --> (Concept Name)_testexecution.ts
* App-scope design changes and interesting moments
  * design --> learning --> design-changes-moments.md

## Final Deliverables

1. Video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kwW1b5DN8QMqN5x0dwFg-Ddlj8RTcm7j/view?usp=sharing
* The actual demonstration starts at about 2 minutes in. The first 2 minutes are more so explaining some snags that affect how this demonstration is shown
* The console output is in [@video_demo_console_output.md](video_demo_console_output.md). Notably, I wasn't able to get the entire console output just because it was so long, and VSCode has a pretty small console display limit that would just cut off the output before I had time to copy and paste it into the file.

2. [@Design Document](design_document.md)

3. [@Project Reflection](project_reflection.md)
