# Project Reflection

While I have gotten frontend experience from an internship, this is the first project in which I have had to design something truly from start to finish. I remember having a good amount of difficulty trying to come up with what topic to center my app around, but in the end I am quite satisfied with what I chose. 

## Hard / Easy (+ A Note about LLM Use)

It is generally a bit hard to assess the difficulty of the project given that the implementation phase feels largely like a question of, "Do you know how to use AI effectively" rather than "Do you have the coding knowledge to implement this." Certainly, given the scope and timeframe of the project, coding without AI sounds rather impractical, but at the same time it can feel a bit monotonous at times and not quite what I had imagined the app-making experience to be.

I would say that the last part of implementing syncs was a bit more difficult though in that:

1) It required rewriting pieces of code that the LLM wasn't always the best at doing. I would find that the written syncs would sometimes use an action with completely wrong parameters, or the LLM simply would say that it could not refactor my code given how the legacy code was structured. The amount of back and forth that I had to do could be rather frustrating.

2) I was unfortunately sick during the timeframe of this assignment, so I had very limited energy and time to spare. Even with extensions, I feel like sync writing could have gone much more smoothly if I didn't feel rushed to complete it (as I have fallen quite behind in academics in general).

3) I would find discrepancies in what code worked in localhost and what worked on Render. After having spent a lot of time refining code so that my app looked as I intended in localhost, I was looking forward to seeing the final deployed product on Render only to be met with a bunch of errors again.

## Skills

I definitely learned a lot about how to think from a consumer's perspective. I remember that during my internship, a big concept was about "working backwards," which was about structuring work around what is actually helpful and desired by the consumer; I think this project has equipped me with good tips on how to properly execute that. 

I did have a few hiccups when trying to define the scope of my project. Originally, I had planned to have not just what my app currently has but also a Maps tab with an accumulated collection of markers indicating the locations of the user's and their friends' sightings. The limit of 5 concepts stopped me from going through with this though, luckily.
