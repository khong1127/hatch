Turn your design notes (recording your ideas, changes, and observations) into a coherent document of one to two pages in length that summarizes how your final design differs from your initial concept design in Assignment 2 and your visual design in Assignment 4b. Be succinct and to the point, and use bullets and subheadings to make it easy to navigate. Feel free to use diagrams and screenshots to illustrate your points if helpful. To refer to particular versions of concept specifications and prompts, use links to the immutable snapshots.
